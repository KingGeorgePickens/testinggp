  As of the evening of 3/27/25, LCPS has taken down George Pickens. <br><br>
  We are assessing our options and will keep you posted as the situation progresses. <br><br>
  This project means a lot to us, and we couldn't have done it without you all. <br><br>
  Thank you all for your constant support. <br><br><br><br>
  See you soon, <br><br><br><br>
  The George Pickens Team
